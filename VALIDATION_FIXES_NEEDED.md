- **Failed**: 1 ❌

## Issues Found

### ❌ CRITICAL - Must Fix

#### 1. position-review-skill

### ⚠️ WARNINGS - Review Needed

**Issue**: Description contains the word "Anthropic"
- **Current**: "Applies Anthropic's official brand colors..."

**Location**: [skills/brand-guidelines/SKILL.md](skills/brand-guidelines/SKILL.md)

#### 3. skill-creator

**Issue**: Description contains 'anthropic' or 'claude'
- **Status**: Need to verify if this is intentional
- **Action**: Review the description to see context

**Location**: [skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md](skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md)

## Understanding the 'name' Field

According to Anthropic's validation requirements:

### What 'name' is For

The `name` field in SKILL.md frontmatter is the **internal identifier** for the skill, not the display name.

- **Format**: lowercase-letters-numbers-hyphens-only
- **Max Length**: 64 characters
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ `position-review-processor`
  - ✅ `excel-data-formatter`
  - ✅ `recruiting-eval-2024`
  - ❌ `Position Review` (spaces, uppercase)
  - ❌ `excel_formatter` (underscores not allowed)

### Where to Put the Human-Readable Name

The human-readable display name should go in:
1. The **first H1 heading** in the markdown content (after the frontmatter)
2. The **description** field if you want it to appear in listings

**Example**:
```yaml
---
name: position-review-processor
description: Processes Oracle Cloud Recruiting requisitions and formats them for weekly position review meetings.
---

# Position Review Meeting Processor
```

## Fixes to Apply

### Fix 1: position-review-skill

**Before**:
```yaml
---
name: Position Review Meeting Processor
description: Processes Oracle Cloud Recruiting requisitions and formats them for weekly position review meetings. Filters positions needing approval and creates structured Excel reports.
---
```

**After**:
```yaml
---
name: position-review-processor
description: Processes Oracle Cloud Recruiting requisitions and formats them for weekly position review meetings. Filters positions needing approval and creates structured Excel reports.
---
```

**Note**: The H1 heading in the content can still be "Position Review Meeting Processor" for display purposes.

### Fix 2 & 3: Review warnings

1. Check [skills/brand-guidelines/SKILL.md](skills/brand-guidelines/SKILL.md) - confirm "Anthropic" is intentional (✅ it is)
2. Check [skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md](skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md) - verify context of 'anthropic' or 'claude'

## Validation Checklist

After applying fixes:

- [ ] Run `python3 scripts/validate-skills.py` again
- [ ] Verify all skills pass (or only have acceptable warnings)
- [ ] Test that skills still load correctly in Claude Desktop
- [ ] Commit changes to the agent-validation branch
- [ ] Update SKILL_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md with results

## Additional Quality Improvements

While not required for passing validation, consider:

1. **Description Quality**: Ensure descriptions include:
   - WHAT the skill does
   - WHEN to use it (trigger context)
   - Specific file types or operations mentioned

2. **Testing**: Test each skill to ensure it activates in appropriate contexts

3. **Documentation**: Ensure README.md files are clear and up-to-date
