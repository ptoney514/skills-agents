**Impact on Total Score:**

- Can be decisive between similarly qualified candidates

---

**Overall Risk Flags Score Calculation:**

Risk Flags Total = (Employment Gaps × 0.25) + (Job Hopping × 0.25) + (Skill Currency × 0.25) + (Application Quality × 0.25)

**Example:**
- Employment Gaps: 90
- Job Hopping: 85
- Skill Currency: 90
- Application Quality: 95
- **Risk Flags Total:** (90 × 0.25) + (85 × 0.25) + (90 × 0.25) + (95 × 0.25) = 90

## Common Scoring Mistakes

### Over-weighting Resume
❌ "They went to an elite school, so they must be great" (ignoring poor interview)
✓ Resume got them the interview; interview performance determines the hire

### Under-weighting References
❌ "References are always positive, so I'll ignore them"
✓ References reveal patterns and validate (or contradict) interview observations

### Halo Effect
❌ "They answered one question brilliantly, so everything else must be great"
✓ Score each component independently based on actual evidence

### Comparison Bias
❌ "This candidate is better than the last three, so they're a hire"
✓ Score against job requirements, not against other weak candidates

### Confirmation Bias
❌ "Their resume was great, so I only heard the positive in the interview"
✓ Actively look for evidence that contradicts your initial impression

### Recency Bias
❌ "They stumbled on the last question, so the whole interview was weak"
✓ Consider the full body of evidence across the entire process
