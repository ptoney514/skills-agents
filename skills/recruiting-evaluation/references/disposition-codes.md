# Disposition Codes Guide

This reference provides common disposition codes used in Oracle Recruiting and other ATS systems, along with when to use each and sample communication templates.

## Standard Disposition Codes

### Qualification-Based Dispositions

#### "Lacks Required Experience"
**Use when**: Candidate doesn't have sufficient years or type of experience
**Example**: Role requires 5 years software engineering, candidate has 2 years
**Communication tone**: Encouraging, mention future opportunities
**Sample message**: "Thank you for your interest. While your background is impressive, this role requires 5+ years of experience. We encourage you to apply for our associate-level positions or reapply as you gain more experience."

#### "Lacks Required Skills/Certifications"
**Use when**: Missing critical technical skills or required credentials
**Example**: Role requires CPA, candidate doesn't have it
**Communication tone**: Direct, specific about requirement
**Sample message**: "Thank you for applying. This position requires [specific certification/skill]. We encourage you to apply once you've obtained this qualification."

#### "Lacks Required Education"
**Use when**: Educational requirements not met
**Example**: Role requires Bachelor's degree, candidate has Associate's
**Communication tone**: Professional, acknowledge other qualifications
**Sample message**: "We appreciate your interest. This role requires a Bachelor's degree. We encourage you to explore other opportunities that may be a better fit."

#### "Overqualified"
**Use when**: Candidate significantly exceeds role requirements, flight risk concern
**Example**: VP applying for manager role
**Communication tone**: Respectful, acknowledge their experience
**Sample message**: "Thank you for your interest. Given your extensive background, we believe this role may not provide the challenge and growth you're seeking. We encourage you to explore our senior-level opportunities."

### Fit-Based Dispositions

#### "Not a Cultural Fit"
**Use when**: Values misalignment, work style incompatibility (use sparingly and with documentation)
**Example**: Fast-paced startup culture, candidate seeking structured corporate environment
**Communication tone**: Professional, keep vague
**Sample message**: "Thank you for your application. After careful consideration, we've decided to move forward with other candidates whose experience more closely aligns with our needs."

#### "Location/Relocation Not Feasible"
**Use when**: Geographic constraints can't be resolved
**Example**: On-site role in NYC, candidate can't relocate
**Communication tone**: Understanding, factual
**Sample message**: "Thank you for your interest. Unfortunately, this role requires on-site presence in [location] and we understand relocation isn't feasible at this time."

#### "Compensation Expectations Misaligned"
**Use when**: Salary expectations too far apart to negotiate
**Example**: Budget is $80-90K, candidate requires $130K minimum
**Communication tone**: Professional, brief
**Sample message**: "Thank you for your application. After reviewing your salary requirements, we don't believe we can meet your expectations for this role."

### Process-Based Dispositions

#### "Selected Another Candidate"
**Use when**: Strong candidate but another was better fit
**Example**: Multiple qualified finalists, chose one
**Communication tone**: Positive, encourage future applications
**Sample message**: "Thank you for your interest and time throughout our process. We've chosen to move forward with another candidate whose experience was slightly more aligned with our specific needs. We were impressed by your qualifications and encourage you to apply for future opportunities."

#### "Position Filled"
**Use when**: Role closed before reviewing this candidate
**Example**: Quick hire, remaining applications not reviewed
**Communication tone**: Brief, apologetic
**Sample message**: "Thank you for your application. The position has been filled. We encourage you to check our careers page for other opportunities."

#### "Candidate Withdrew"
**Use when**: Candidate removed themselves from consideration
**Example**: Accepted another offer, no longer interested

**Sample message**: "Thank you for letting us know. We wish you the best in your new role. Please keep us in mind for future opportunities."

#### "No Response from Candidate"
**Use when**: Candidate didn't respond to outreach attempts
**Example**: Sent 3 emails over 2 weeks, no reply
**Communication tone**: No message typically sent
**Sample message**: None (just close requisition in ATS)

### Quality-Based Dispositions

#### "Resume Quality Issues"
**Use when**: Unprofessional presentation, many errors, red flags
**Example**: Multiple typos, formatting problems, inappropriate content
**Communication tone**: Generic, brief
**Sample message**: "Thank you for your interest. We've decided to move forward with other candidates at this time."

#### "Insufficient Detail/Information"
**Use when**: Can't evaluate because resume lacks necessary information
**Example**: Vague descriptions, missing dates, no clear experience

#### "Application Incomplete"

**Sample message**: "We noticed your application was incomplete. Please resubmit with all required materials if you're still interested in the role."

### Timing-Based Dispositions

#### "Not Currently Available"
**Use when**: Timeline doesn't align with role needs
**Example**: Can't start for 6 months, need filled in 1 month
**Communication tone**: Understanding, keep door open
**Sample message**: "Thank you for your interest. While your qualifications are strong, your availability doesn't align with our current timeline. We encourage you to apply for future opportunities."

#### "Hired for Different Role"
**Use when**: Candidate accepted different position in company
**Example**: Applied for Role A and Role B, accepted Role B
**Communication tone**: Congratulatory

## Best Practices for Dispositioning

### Documentation Requirements

Always document in ATS:
1. **Primary reason** for disposition (use appropriate code)
2. **Supporting notes** with specific details
3. **Date** of decision
4. **Reviewer** name/ID

**Example note**: "Disposition: QUALS - Lacks Required Experience. Position requires 5+ years managing enterprise sales teams. Candidate has 2 years experience managing small team. Consider for Associate Account Executive roles."

### Communication Guidelines

**When to send disposition emails:**
- ✓ Candidate completed phone screen or beyond
- ✓ Candidate was specifically recruited/sourced (not cold applicant)
- ✓ Strong candidate you may want to recruit later
- ✓ Internal candidate or referral

**When generic rejection is okay:**
- Cold applicants who don't meet basic qualifications
- Resume screen stage only
- Large volume of clearly unqualified applicants

### Tone & Messaging

**DO:**
- Thank them for their interest/time
- Be specific about requirements when appropriate
- Encourage future applications if applicable
- Keep it brief and professional
- Send within 1 week of decision

**DON'T:**
- Give false hope ("we'll keep your resume on file")
- Provide excessive detail about why they weren't selected
- Mention other candidates
- Use discriminatory language
- Ghost candidates (always close loop eventually)

### Legal Compliance

**Protected from discrimination**: Age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, genetic information, pregnancy, veteran status

**Documentation should:**
- Focus on job-related qualifications only
- Use consistent standards across candidates
- Be factual and specific
- Avoid any mention of protected characteristics
- Be defendable if questioned

**Red flag documentation**: "Too old for the role" ❌
**Appropriate documentation**: "Lacks required Python experience (0 years vs 3+ required)" ✓

### Candidate Experience

Even in rejection, create positive experience:
- **Timely**: Respond within 1-2 weeks
- **Personal**: Use name, acknowledge their specific background
- **Respectful**: Thank them sincerely
- **Helpful**: Point to other opportunities when appropriate
- **Open**: Encourage future applications if they're strong

### Special Cases

#### Internal Candidates
- Always provide direct feedback (don't just send template)
- Offer to discuss decision
- Be constructive about development areas
- Consider manager relationship

#### Referrals
- Higher touch communication required
- Thank the referrer separately
- Be especially thoughtful and specific
- Keep door open for future

#### Passive Candidates You Sourced
- More personalized outreach
- Acknowledge you reached out to them
- Keep warm for future roles
- Thank them for their time

#### Silver Medalists
- High-quality candidates who were close
- Create talent pool/pipeline tag
- Stay in touch for future roles
- Consider for similar openings
