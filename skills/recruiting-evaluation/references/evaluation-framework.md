# Evaluation Framework

This framework provides a structured approach to evaluating candidates consistently and fairly.

## Scoring Methodology

### Phase 1: Knockout Criteria Check

Before detailed evaluation, check if candidate meets ALL knockout criteria:

- **Education Requirements**: Does the candidate have required degrees, certifications, or licenses?
- **Legal Requirements**: Can the candidate legally work in required location?
- **Location**: Is the candidate able to work from required location (if on-site/hybrid)?
- **Critical Experience**: Does the candidate have the absolutely required years/type of experience?
- **Core Skills**: Does the candidate possess the non-negotiable technical or specialized skills?

**If ANY knockout criterion fails → DISPOSITION immediately**

### Phase 2: Must-Have Requirements Scoring

Score each must-have requirement on a scale:
- **3 points**: Exceeds requirement (e.g., 8 years when 5 required)
- **2 points**: Meets requirement exactly
- **1 point**: Partially meets requirement (e.g., 4 years when 5 required)
- **0 points**: Does not meet requirement

Common must-have categories:
1. **Relevant Work Experience**
   - Years in similar role
   - Industry experience
   - Company size/stage experience
   
2. **Technical Skills**
   - Programming languages/frameworks
   - Tools and platforms
   - Methodologies (Agile, Six Sigma, etc.)
   
3. **Domain Knowledge**
   - Industry-specific expertise
   - Regulatory knowledge
   - Process familiarity
   
4. **Leadership/Management**
   - Team size managed
   - Budget responsibility
   - Cross-functional leadership

**Must-Have Score Interpretation:**
- **80%+ of maximum points**: Strong candidate → Consider ADVANCE or REQUEST INTERVIEW
- **60-79% of maximum**: Moderate candidate → Consider HOLD or REQUEST INTERVIEW
- **Below 60%**: Weak candidate → Consider DISPOSITION

### Phase 3: Preferred Qualifications Assessment

Evaluate preferred (nice-to-have) qualifications:
- Advanced degrees (MBA, MS, PhD) when preferred
- Additional certifications
- Specific industry experience
- Leadership training
- Special projects or achievements
- Publications, patents, speaking engagements
- Relevant volunteer or side projects

**Preferred qualifications can elevate a candidate from HOLD to ADVANCE or from ADVANCE to high-priority.**

### Phase 4: Red Flags & Green Flags Analysis

#### Red Flags (Proceed with caution)
- Frequent job changes (3+ jobs in 3 years) without clear progression
- Large unexplained gaps in employment (ask before assuming)
- Declining responsibility or titles over time
- Salary expectations 30%+ above budget
- Location constraints incompatible with role
- Poor communication in application materials
- Lack of specific details about accomplishments
- Generic or template-like cover letter
- Overqualification that suggests flight risk

#### Green Flags (Strong positive indicators)
- Progressive career growth (promotions, expanding scope)
- Quantified achievements (revenue growth, efficiency gains, etc.)
- Relevant side projects or continuous learning
- Internal referral or recommendation
- Industry awards or recognition
- Leadership in professional organizations
- Strong written communication in application
- Thoughtful, customized cover letter
- Fast response times during application process

### Phase 5: Overall Fit Assessment

Consider holistic fit:

**Cultural Alignment**
- Do their career moves suggest values aligned with company?
- Does their communication style fit company culture?
- Do their interests align with company mission?

**Career Trajectory**
- Is this role a logical next step?
- Are they likely to grow with the company?
- Does role match their stated career goals?

**Practical Considerations**
- Timeline availability (notice period, start date)
- Compensation alignment
- Remote/hybrid/on-site fit
- Relocation feasibility if needed

## Decision Matrix

| Must-Have Score | Red Flags | Green Flags | Recommended Action |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 80%+ | None | 2+ | **ADVANCE** - Strong candidate |
| 80%+ | None | 0-1 | **REQUEST INTERVIEW** - Verify fit |
| 80%+ | 1-2 minor | 2+ | **REQUEST INTERVIEW** - Address concerns |
| 60-79% | None | 3+ | **REQUEST INTERVIEW** - Strong potential |
| 60-79% | 1-2 minor | 1-2 | **HOLD** - Need more information |
| 60-79% | 2+ major | Any | **DISPOSITION** - Too many concerns |
| Below 60% | Any | Any | **DISPOSITION** - Insufficient qualifications |

## Special Scenarios

### Career Changers
For candidates transitioning from different fields:
- Assess transferable skills heavily
- Look for relevant coursework, certifications, or projects
- Consider passion and motivation indicators
- May have lower experience score but high potential

### Internal Candidates
For internal transfers or promotions:
- Consider current performance and reputation
- Assess cultural fit as pre-validated
- Look for growth trajectory within organization
- May weigh soft skills and company knowledge more heavily

### Overqualified Candidates
When candidate appears overqualified:
- Assess flight risk carefully
- Look for clear motivation (relocation, career change, lifestyle)
- Consider compensation expectations
- Verify they understand the role level
- May need additional interview to confirm genuine interest

### Resume Gaps
When employment gaps are present:
- Do not assume negative reasons
- Common valid reasons: caregiving, education, health, layoffs, entrepreneurship
- Focus on skills currency and ability to ramp up
- If concerned, can note to ask during interview

## Calibration Tips

To ensure consistent evaluation across candidates:

1. **Establish baseline**: Review first 5-10 candidates to set standard
2. **Use reference candidates**: Keep examples of "strong," "moderate," and "weak" candidates
3. **Regular check-ins**: Every 20-30 candidates, review decisions for consistency
4. **Avoid comparison bias**: Each candidate against job requirements, not against each other
5. **Document reasoning**: Always note specific evidence for decisions

## Equity & Fairness Checklist

Before finalizing any recommendation, verify:
- ✓ Evaluation based solely on job-related qualifications
- ✓ No assumptions based on name, gender indicators, or school prestige
- ✓ Same standards applied to all candidates
- ✓ Gaps or non-traditional paths not penalized without cause
- ✓ Objective evidence cited for all concerns
- ✓ No protected characteristics influenced decision
