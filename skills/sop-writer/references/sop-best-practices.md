# SOP Writing Best Practices

## Core Principles

### Clarity and Precision
- Use simple, direct language
- Define technical terms on first use
- Avoid ambiguous words like "may," "might," "should"
- Use "must" for requirements, "can" for options

### Actionable Steps
- Write steps as imperative commands (Start with action verbs)
- One action per step when possible
- Number sequential steps
- Use bullet points for non-sequential items

### Completeness
- Include all prerequisites and materials needed
- Document expected outcomes for each major step
- Include troubleshooting for common issues
- Specify decision points and criteria

## SOP Structure Components

### Title
- Clear, descriptive name
- Include version number and date
- Example: "Customer Onboarding Process v2.1 - Updated Oct 2025"

### Purpose
- 1-2 sentences explaining why this SOP exists
- Who should use it and when

### Scope
- What is covered
- What is explicitly NOT covered
- Any limitations or boundaries

### Definitions
- Key terms and acronyms
- Technical jargon specific to the process
- Role definitions if multiple people involved

### Roles and Responsibilities
- Who performs each part
- Who approves or reviews
- Escalation contacts

### Prerequisites
- Required training or certifications
- Tools, systems, or access needed
- Materials or documents required
- Environmental conditions

### Procedure Steps
The core of the SOP - the actual step-by-step instructions

### Quality Checks
- Verification points throughout the process
- Final quality assurance steps
- Success criteria

### Troubleshooting
- Common problems and solutions
- When to escalate
- Contact information for support

### References
- Related SOPs or documents
- External resources
- Regulatory requirements

### Revision History
- Version number
- Date of change
- What changed
- Who made the change

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Action Verbs to Use
- Click, Select, Enter, Choose, Verify, Confirm
- Review, Approve, Submit, Upload, Download
- Open, Close, Save, Print, Export
- Navigate to, Go to, Access, Log in

### Formatting Best Practices
- **Bold** for UI elements: buttons, menu items, field names
- *Italics* for emphasis or important notes
- `Monospace` for code, commands, or system inputs
- > Blockquotes for warnings or critical information

### Notes, Warnings, and Tips
- **NOTE:** Additional helpful information
- **WARNING:** Critical information about potential errors or risks
- **TIP:** Shortcuts or efficiency improvements
- **CAUTION:** Potential for minor issues or confusion

## Quality Metrics

A good SOP should:
- Be executable by someone unfamiliar with the process
- Take no more than 2-3 times longer to complete than an expert would take
- Result in consistent outputs regardless of who follows it
- Be maintainable (easy to update when process changes)
- Be findable (good naming and categorization)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Assuming knowledge** - Don't skip "obvious" steps
2. **Vague instructions** - "Properly configure" vs "Set timeout to 30 seconds"
3. **Missing decision criteria** - "If needed" vs "If error code is 404"
4. **No visual aids** - Screenshots help for complex interfaces
5. **Outdated information** - Review and update regularly
6. **No version control** - Track all changes
7. **Too long** - If over 25 steps, consider breaking into multiple SOPs
8. **No testing** - Always have someone unfamiliar with the process test it
