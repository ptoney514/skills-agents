---

**IMPORTANT:** Conduct 2-3 references per finalist candidate. Average the reference ratings (1-10 scale) for Stage 2 evaluation, where references are weighted at 25% of the final hiring decision.

**Listen for:**
- Enthusiasm level (or lack thereof)
- Specific examples vs. vague generalities
- "Would rehire" is the most telling question
- Code words: "adequate" = not great, "tries hard" = struggled
- What's NOT said is often as important as what is
