## Tips for Effective Questions

### Do:
✓ Ask open-ended questions that require examples
✓ Use behavioral questions (past behavior predicts future)
✓ Ask follow-up probes: "Tell me more," "What was your specific role?"
✓ Listen for specific examples and STAR format
✓ Ask the same core questions of all candidates
✓ Take detailed notes

### Don't:
✗ Ask leading questions that hint at the "right" answer
✗ Ask hypothetical questions without also asking behavioral
✗ Ask yes/no questions
✗ Ask questions about protected characteristics
✗ Let the candidate ramble without redirecting
✗ Fill silence - give them time to think

- Marital status or family plans

- Disability (except essential functions with accommodations)
- Pregnancy or plans to have children
- Sexual orientation or gender identity (in most contexts)
