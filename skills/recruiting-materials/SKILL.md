## Template Structure

All materials follow this consistent structure:

**üîµ STANDARD SECTIONS**

## Integration with Recruiting-Evaluation Skill

This skill works hand-in-hand with the `recruiting-evaluation` skill:

**Workflow:**
1. User provides resume ‚Üí `recruiting-evaluation` runs Stage 1
2. Stage 1 outputs candidate-specific verification questions
3. User requests phone screen script ‚Üí `recruiting-materials` generates it (includes verification questions)
4. After phone screen passes ‚Üí `recruiting-materials` generates interview guide + evaluation form
5. After interview ‚Üí interviewer completes evaluation form
6. User provides completed form ‚Üí `recruiting-evaluation` runs Stage 2
7. Stage 2 uses interview rating (50%), resume score (25%), references (25%)

**Key Connection Points:**
- Stage 1 verification questions ‚Üí included in phone screen scripts and interview guides
- Evaluation form ratings ‚Üí feed into Stage 2 scoring (50% weight)
- Reference check ratings ‚Üí feed into Stage 2 scoring (25% weight)

## Best Practices

### Fairness & Legal Compliance

‚úì **Use identical standardized questions** for all candidates
‚úì **Only vary candidate-specific sections** based on resume gaps
‚úì **Rate against requirements**, not against other candidates
‚úì **Document specific examples** for all ratings
‚úì **Avoid protected characteristic questions** (age, religion, family status, etc.)
‚úì **Get candidate permission** before checking references

### Quality & Consistency

‚úì **Complete evaluation forms immediately** after interviews (while fresh)
‚úì **Check minimum 2-3 references** (not just one)
‚úì **Use verification questions strategically** (only what you need to verify)
‚úì **Keep all materials for 1-2 years** (for compliance/recordkeeping)
‚úì **File naming convention**: Position_MaterialType_CandidateName_Date.md

### Effective Usage

‚úì **Phone screens first** - even for strong candidates (saves time)
‚úì **Print evaluation forms** - easier than typing during interview
‚úì **Brief interviewers beforehand** - review standardized questions
‚úì **Take notes during interviews** - support your ratings with evidence
