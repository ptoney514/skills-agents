## 🎨 Visual Standards & Best Practices

### Color-Coded for Clarity

Every diagram uses consistent colors:

- 🟢 **Green** (#4caf50): Success, approved, completed
- 🔴 **Red** (#f44336): Error, rejected, blocked
- 🟡 **Yellow** (#ffeb3b): **Customization** (your custom Oracle elements)
- 🟠 **Orange** (#ff9800): Escalation, high priority
- 🔵 **Blue** (#2196f3): Standard Oracle
- 🟣 **Purple** (#9c27b0): External system
- ⚪ **Gray** (#9e9e9e): Inactive, optional

**Why this matters**: Anyone can understand your diagrams instantly, no legend needed.
