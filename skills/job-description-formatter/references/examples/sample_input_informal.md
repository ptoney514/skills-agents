**Subject: Need to post for new development coordinator position**

Hey - we need to hire someone for the Development Coordinator role at the retreat center. Here's what I'm thinking:

**The Role:**
- Help coordinate our fundraising events (gala, golf tournament, appeal campaigns)
- Manage donor database (we use Raiser's Edge)
- Write thank you letters and donor communications
- Help with grant applications
- Some event planning support
- Part of the advancement team, reports to Director of Development

**What we need:**
- MUST be Catholic in good standing - this is important for our mission
- Some fundraising or nonprofit experience (2-3 years would be great)
- Good writer - they'll be doing a lot of donor communications
- Detail-oriented for database work
- Team player, comfortable in a small faith-based community
- Knowledge of Ignatian Spirituality is a huge plus but not required
- Bachelor's degree preferred

**Logistics:**
- Full time, $42K-$48K depending on experience
- Benefits included (health, dental, retirement match)
- On-site at Cristo Rey Jesuit Retreat Center in Phoenix
- Some evening/weekend work during events
- We serve 5,000 retreatants annually across our 45-acre desert property

**Culture fit:**
- We're a small team (15 staff total)
- Very mission-driven
- Collaborative environment
- Need someone who loves the work even when it's unglamorous
- Prayer and spirituality are part of our daily rhythm

Want this posted by next Friday if possible. Should probably mention that we're part of the Jesuit network and emphasize the mission/spiritual aspect since that's really important for this role.

Let me know if you need anything else!
