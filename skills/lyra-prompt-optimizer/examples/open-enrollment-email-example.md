## Original Request (Vague)

```

## Lyra's Analysis

### DECONSTRUCT
- **Core Intent:** Communicate open enrollment information to employees
- **Key Entities:** Email, open enrollment, benefits
- **Missing Context:**
  - What's changing this year?
  - Who is the audience (all employees? specific groups?)?
  - What action do employees need to take?
  - What are key dates and deadlines?
  - What tone fits the organizational culture?

### DIAGNOSE
- **Clarity Issues:** No purpose beyond general announcement
- **Specificity Gaps:** No changes noted, no deadlines, no call-to-action
- **Complexity Level:** BASIC mode sufficient (straightforward communication)
- **Audience Needs:** Employees need clarity on what's changing, what to do, and by when

### DEVELOP
**Techniques to Apply:**
- Role Assignment (Benefits communications specialist)
- Context Layering (Organization, changes, deadlines)
- Audience Calibration (Employee-friendly, action-oriented)
- Message Structuring (Key messages hierarchy)
- Tone Setting (Professional but accessible)

## Optimized Prompt

```
You are a benefits communications specialist drafting an open enrollment 
announcement email for Creighton University employees.

PURPOSE:
Inform employees about the upcoming benefits open enrollment period, 
highlight key changes, and drive timely enrollment completion.

CONTEXT:
- Organization: Creighton University (higher education, Catholic Jesuit values)
- Audience: All benefits-eligible employees (faculty and staff)
- Enrollment Period: November 1-15, 2024
- Key Changes This Year:
  * New mental health benefits through Lyra Health
  * HSA contribution limits increased to $4,150 (individual) / $8,300 (family)
  * New voluntary benefits: Pet insurance, Legal services
  * No changes to medical/dental/vision plan options
- Current Situation: First fully remote open enrollment (no paper forms)

KEY MESSAGES (in priority order):
1. Open enrollment runs November 1-15 (must enroll by 11:59pm on Nov 15)
2. Action required even if keeping same coverage (system reset)
3. Exciting new mental health benefit (Lyra Health)
4. New voluntary benefits available (pet insurance, legal services)
5. Virtual benefits fair on November 5 at 2pm (Teams link)
6. HR support available via drop-in hours and email

REQUIRED ELEMENTS:

- Consistent with Creighton's mission-driven, supportive culture

FORMAT:
- Email length: 200-300 words (scannable, not overwhelming)
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)

- Include clear call-to-action buttons/links (if HTML email)

AVOID:
- Benefits jargon without explanation

- Making it sound like homework

BONUS ELEMENTS TO CONSIDER:
- Quick summary box with "Need to Know" highlights

🆕 What's New: Mental health benefit, pet insurance, legal services
💰 HSA Limits Increased: $4,150 individual / $8,300 family

[Body continues with details, resources, and call-to-action...]
```

### Time Saved:
- **Original (vague prompt):** 20-30 minutes drafting + 3-4 revision cycles
- **Optimized:** 5 minutes to customize details and get polished email

### Quality Improvement:
- **Before:** Generic template requiring heavy customization
- **After:** Organization-specific, culturally aligned, action-oriented communication

## Pro Tips for Further Refinement

🎯 **Add personalization:**
- "Include employee's current plan elections for easy comparison"
- "Segment message for employees with vs. without dependents"
- "Add section for new hires (first open enrollment)"

🎯 **For follow-up communications:**
- "Create a reminder email for November 10 (5 days before deadline)"
- "Draft a final 48-hour reminder with urgent tone"
- "Write FAQ based on top 10 questions we're receiving"

🎯 **For different audiences:**
- "Create executive summary version for senior leadership"
- "Write simplified version for hourly/part-time employees"
- "Draft FAQ-style format for intranet posting"

🎯 **For supporting materials:**
- "Create decision tree: 'Which health plan is right for me?'"
- "Design comparison chart of medical plan options"
- "Write script for benefits fair presentation"

## Common Variations

### Variation 1: Mid-Enrollment Reminder
```
Change purpose to: "Remind employees who haven't enrolled and address 
common questions we're receiving"

Add context: "As of November 8, 35% of employees have completed enrollment"

Update tone: "More urgent but still supportive"
```

### Variation 2: Policy Change Announcement
```
Change purpose to: "Communicate significant policy change and manage concerns"

Add context: "Remote work policy changing from unlimited to hybrid (3 days/week)"

Update tone: "Empathetic, change management focus, address anticipated concerns"
```

### Variation 3: Crisis Communication
```
Change purpose to: "Communicate urgent situation and provide reassurance"

Add context: "Campus safety incident, no ongoing threat, counseling available"

Update tone: "Calm, factual, supportive, clear on resources"
```

## Use This Pattern For:
- Policy change announcements
- Program launches
- Company-wide updates
- Crisis communications
- Celebration announcements (promotions, anniversaries)
- Seasonal reminders (timecard deadlines, performance reviews)
- Change management communications
- Any employee-facing message requiring clarity and action
