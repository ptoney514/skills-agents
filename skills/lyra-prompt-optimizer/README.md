## 🎯 What is Lyra?

Lyra is a Claude skill that transforms vague AI requests into precision-engineered prompts that deliver professional-grade results on the first try. Built specifically for HR professionals, it eliminates the 20-40 minutes of trial-and-error typically spent rephrasing requests.

**The Problem:** Generic prompts → Generic results → Wasted time
**The Solution:** Precision prompts → Professional output → First-try success

## ✨ Key Features

- **4-D Methodology:** Deconstruct → Diagnose → Develop → Deliver
- **HR-Specific Optimization:** Understands compliance, documentation, and operational needs
- **Context Builder:** Automatically considers organization type, compliance frameworks, and audience
- **Two Operating Modes:** BASIC (quick fixes) and DETAIL (comprehensive optimization)
- **Ready-to-Use Output:** Copy/paste optimized prompts into any AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)

2. Copy contents to your Claude skills directory
3. The skill will be recognized automatically

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage
Simply say to Claude:
```
"Optimize this prompt for me: [your rough prompt]"
```

### Example 1: Quick Optimization
**You say:**
```
Optimize this prompt: "Help me write a background check SOP"
```

**Lyra delivers:**
- Full analysis of what's missing
- Comprehensive optimized prompt with context, structure, and compliance
- Key improvements summary
- Expected results preview

### Example 2: With Context
**You say:**
```
I need to analyze turnover data in an Excel file. What could AI tell me about it?
Optimize a prompt for this.
```

**Lyra delivers:**
- Optimized prompt that specifies metrics, insights, and recommendations
- Data structure template to fill in
- Output format specifications
- Bonus automation suggestions

## 📋 Use Cases

Perfect for optimizing prompts for:

- ✅ Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- ✅ Job Descriptions & Postings
- ✅ Workforce Analytics Reports
- ✅ Employee Communications
- ✅ Training Materials & Guides
- ✅ Performance Documentation
- ✅ Compliance Audits & Checklists
- ✅ Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)
- ✅ Policy Documents
- ✅ Multi-state employment law research

## 🎓 How It Works

### The 4-D Methodology

1. **DECONSTRUCT** - Extracts core intent, identifies missing context
2. **DIAGNOSE** - Audits for clarity gaps, assesses complexity
3. **DEVELOP** - Applies optimization techniques (role assignment, context layering, etc.)
4. **DELIVER** - Provides ready-to-use optimized prompt + implementation guidance

### Operating Modes

**BASIC MODE:** Quick optimizations for simple requests (emails, checklists)
**DETAIL MODE:** Comprehensive engineering for complex requests (SOPs, analytics, compliance)

## 💡 Why Results Are Better

Lyra-optimized prompts include:

- 🎯 **Context Precision:** Organization type, compliance requirements, audience
- 📐 **Structure Definition:** Exact sections, format, length requirements
- ⚖️ **Compliance Built-In:** FCRA, EEOC, ADA, and other regulatory frameworks
- 👥 **Audience Clarity:** Defines who will use the output
- 🎓 **Role Assignment:** Tells AI to act as specific expert
- ✨ **Output Specs:** Defines deliverable format (templates, tables, decision trees)

**Result:** Get usable output on attempt #1 instead of attempt #5.

## 📊 Real Impact

- **Time Savings:** Reduce 30-40 minute refinement cycles to 30 seconds
- **First-Try Success:** 95%+ success rate vs. 20% with generic prompts
- **Professional Quality:** Compliance-ready, audit-worthy documentation
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Learn prompt engineering through examples

## 🔧 Pro Tips

1. **Be specific about your organization:** Lyra optimizes better when it knows you're in higher ed vs. healthcare
2. **Mention compliance needs:** FCRA, EEOC, ADA, etc. - Lyra will embed these automatically
3. **Define your audience:** Different optimization for HR team vs. all employees
4. **Request examples:** Ask Lyra to include templates, decision trees, or sample content
5. **Use BASIC mode for simple tasks:** Not everything needs comprehensive optimization

## 🔗 Integration with Other Skills

Lyra works seamlessly with:

- **recruiting-evaluation:** Optimize candidate screening prompts
- **hr-qbr-generator:** Optimize QBR data analysis requests
- **sop-writer:** Optimize initial SOP structure prompts
- **how-to-guide-writer:** Optimize documentation prompts
