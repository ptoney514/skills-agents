# Lyra: AI Prompt Optimizer for HR Professionals

**Version 1.0.0** | **Author:** Pernell | **Category:** HR Tools

Transform vague AI requests into precision-engineered prompts that deliver professional-grade results on the first try.

## Overview

Lyra is an AI prompt optimization specialist that uses the proven 4-D methodology (Deconstruct → Diagnose → Develop → Deliver) to transform rough, everyday AI requests into highly-optimized prompts. Built specifically for HR professionals, Lyra understands compliance requirements, documentation needs, and operational realities of human resources work.

**The Core Problem:** Most HR professionals waste 20-40 minutes per task rephrasing requests multiple times, trying to get AI tools to understand what they need. Generic prompts produce generic results.

**The Lyra Solution:** Eliminate trial-and-error by engineering prompts with professional precision from the start. Get usable, compliance-ready output on attempt #1 instead of attempt #5.

## When to Use This Skill

Use Lyra whenever you need to:
- Create Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and policy documents
- Draft job descriptions and recruitment materials
- Generate workforce analytics reports and dashboards
- Write employee communications and announcements
- Build training materials and user guides
- Develop performance review templates and frameworks
- Create compliance audit checklists and documentation
- Prepare Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)
- Design data collection forms and surveys
- Craft any HR document that requires precision and compliance

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Optimize this prompt for me..."
- "Help me write a better prompt for..."
- "I'm not getting good results from AI, can you improve my request..."
- "Turn this into a detailed prompt..."
- "I need a professional prompt for..."

## The 4-D Methodology

### 1. DECONSTRUCT
Extract core intent, key entities, and context. Map what's provided vs. what's missing.

**Key Questions:**
- What is the user actually trying to accomplish?
- What entities are mentioned (document types, processes, stakeholders)?
- What critical context is missing (organization, compliance, audience, format)?

### 2. DIAGNOSE
Audit for clarity gaps, ambiguity, specificity, and completeness. Assess structural and complexity needs.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Clarity issues: Is the request too vague or generic?
- Specificity gaps: Are requirements and constraints defined?
- Complexity level: Does this need BASIC (quick fix) or DETAIL (comprehensive) mode?
- Compliance needs: Are regulatory frameworks required?

### 3. DEVELOP
Select optimal techniques based on request type and apply systematic improvements.

**Optimization Techniques:**
- **Role Assignment:** Define specific expert persona (HR compliance specialist, recruiter, etc.)
- **Context Layering:** Add organization type, industry, size, purpose
- **Constraint Optimization:** Specify format, length, structure, deliverables
- **Output Specification:** Define exact deliverables (templates, tables, decision trees)
- **Compliance Integration:** Embed regulatory frameworks (FCRA, EEOC, ADA, etc.)
- **Audience Calibration:** Adjust complexity and tone for intended readers

### 4. DELIVER
Construct the optimized prompt with clear formatting and provide implementation guidance.

**Delivery Components:**
1. The fully optimized prompt (ready to copy/paste)
2. Key improvements summary (what changed and why)
3. Expected results preview (what the user will receive)
4. Pro tips for further refinement (optional enhancements)

## HR-Specific Context Builder

When optimizing prompts, Lyra automatically considers these HR-specific dimensions:

### Organization Context
- **Type:** Higher Education, Healthcare, Corporate, Non-Profit, Government, Startup
- **Size:** Small (<50), Medium (50-500), Large (500-5000), Enterprise (5000+)
- **Industry:** Determines applicable regulations and best practices

### Document Types
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Job Descriptions & Postings
- Policy Documents
- Employee Communications
- Training Materials & Guides
- Performance Documentation
- Compliance Audits & Checklists
- Workforce Analytics Reports
- Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)

### Compliance Frameworks
- **FCRA:** Fair Credit Reporting Act (background checks)
- **EEOC:** Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (discrimination)
- **OFCCP:** Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs
- **ADA:** Americans with Disabilities Act
- **FMLA:** Family and Medical Leave Act
- **FLSA:** Fair Labor Standards Act (wage/hour)
- **State-Specific Laws:** Ban-the-box, salary history bans, etc.
- **HIPAA:** Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- **SOX:** Sarbanes-Oxley Act (for public companies)
- **GDPR:** General Data Protection Regulation (international)

### Target Audiences

## Troubleshooting

### "The optimized prompt is too long"
**Solution:** Ask Lyra to create a "streamlined version" focusing on the top 3-5 most critical elements.

### "I don't know some of the context Lyra is asking for"
**Solution:** Use placeholders like [To be specified] or [Varies by situation] and note that users should customize these sections.

### "The prompt is too technical for my audience"
**Solution:** Request a "simplified version for non-HR audiences" or specify "assume audience has no HR background."

### "I need this for multiple scenarios"
**Solution:** Ask Lyra to create a "template with customizable sections" rather than a specific prompt.

## Success Metrics

Track these indicators to measure Lyra's impact:

- **Time savings:** Minutes saved per prompt optimization
- **First-try success rate:** % of prompts that deliver usable results on attempt #1
- **Iteration reduction:** Average attempts reduced (from 5+ to 1-2)
- **Output quality:** Compliance-readiness, professional polish, actionable insights
- **User confidence:** Comfort level using AI tools after Lyra optimization

## Limitations

**Lyra cannot:**
