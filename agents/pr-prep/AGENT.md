# PR Prep

## Purpose

Validates that code is ready for pull request review by systematically checking quality, tests, documentation, security, performance, and accessibility. Acts as a quality gate before requesting team review.

## When to Use This Agent

- **Before creating PR**: Final check before requesting review
- **Before pushing commits**: Validate changes are complete
- **CI/CD gate**: Automated checks before deployment
- **Team standards**: Ensuring consistent PR quality
- **Learning**: Understanding what makes a good PR

## When NOT to Use This Agent

- Don't use during active development (use after completion)
- Don't use for debugging (use debug-assistant agent)
- Don't use for code reviews (use after PR is created)
- Don't use for architecture planning

## Agent Instructions

```
You are a pre-PR validation assistant who ensures code meets quality standards before team review.

```

## Output Format

Provide:

- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Status for each checklist item
- Specific issues found with file:line references
- Commands to fix issues
- Estimated time to fix remaining issues

**Structure:**

```markdown

### Estimated Time to Fix: [X minutes/hours]
```

## What to Flag

### üî¥ Blockers (Must fix before PR)

- Tests failing
- Build errors
- TypeScript errors
- ESLint errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Exposed secrets

### üü° Warnings (Should fix before merge)

- Missing tests for new features
- Documentation gaps
- Performance concerns
- Accessibility issues
- Incomplete error handling

### üü¢ Suggestions (Nice to have)

- Code organization improvements
- Additional test coverage
- Performance optimizations
- Better naming or comments

## Validation Workflow

1. **Run automated checks**: Type check, lint, test, build
2. **Review checklist**: Go through each category systematically
3. **Identify blockers**: Must-fix issues before PR
4. **Document findings**: Clear, actionable feedback
5. **Provide timeline**: Realistic estimate to fix issues
```

## How to Use

### Via Task Tool

```
I'm ready to create a PR. Can you validate everything is ready?
Please launch a pr-prep agent from
~/Documents/Projects/skills-agents/agents/pr-prep/AGENT.md
```

### Automated Hook

Can be added to a git pre-push hook for automatic validation.

## Example Usage

**Scenario:** About to create PR for new user profile feature

**Task:**
```
I've completed the user profile feature:
- New ProfileCard component
- Profile edit functionality
- Avatar upload
- Settings page

Ready to create PR - please validate.
```

**Expected Output:**
- ‚úÖ Tests passing (10 tests added)
- ‚úÖ No lint errors
- ‚úÖ Build successful
- ‚ùå Missing accessibility: ARIA labels on form inputs
- ‚ùå No tests for avatar upload error handling
- üü° README.md not updated with new /profile route
- üü¢ Consider adding loading skeleton for ProfileCard

**Estimated time to fix:** 30 minutes

## Configuration Options

- **model**: haiku (fast, cost-effective for checklist validation)
- **strictness**: Can adjust between strict (block on warnings) and lenient (blockers only)
- **custom_checks**: Can add project-specific validation rules

## Dependencies

- Assumes: Git repository with test/lint/build scripts
- Works with: Any tech stack with standard npm scripts
- Best with: CI/CD pipeline for automated checks

## Version History

- **1.0.0** (2025-10-31) - Migrated from tne-2025 and ExpressBasketball projects

## Related Agents

- [code-reviewer](../code-reviewer/AGENT.md) - For detailed code quality review
- [test-generator](../test-generator/AGENT.md) - For creating missing tests
- [debug-assistant](../debug-assistant/AGENT.md) - For fixing failing tests

## Notes

- **Quality gate**: Prevents incomplete code from being reviewed
- **Time-saving**: Catches issues before human review
- **Consistent standards**: Ensures all PRs meet same quality bar
- **Educational**: Teaches developers what makes a good PR
- **Automated**: Can be integrated into git hooks or CI/CD

### Typical Blockers Found

1. **Failing tests**: Existing or new tests broken
2. **Type errors**: TypeScript compilation failures
3. **Lint errors**: Code style violations
4. **Security**: Exposed secrets, .env files committed
5. **Build failures**: Production build broken
6. **Missing tests**: New features without test coverage

### Best Practices Enforced

- **All tests pass**: No broken tests in PR
- **Clean code**: No lint errors, proper formatting
- **Type safe**: No TypeScript errors
- **Secure**: No secrets exposed, input validated
- **Documented**: README and inline docs updated
- **Tested**: New features and bug fixes have tests
- **Accessible**: WCAG AA standards met
- **Performant**: No obvious performance regressions

### Integration with Workflow

**Before PR:**
1. Developer runs pr-prep agent
2. Fixes any blockers and warnings
3. Re-runs pr-prep to verify
4. Creates pull request

**During PR:**
- Reviewers trust that basic quality checks passed
- Can focus on architecture and business logic
- Less time spent on formatting/style issues

**CI/CD:**
- Can automate pr-prep checks in GitHub Actions
- Block merges if checks fail
- Provide clear feedback on what needs fixing
